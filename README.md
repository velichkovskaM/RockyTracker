# ü™® RockyTracker - Staying ahead of the slide
Real-time hazard detection system designed to monitor rockfalls across streets and railroads in Slovenia. With one click of a button, subscribe for newsletters that will update you whenever there are rockfalls detected. Not only does it improve public safety but also provides a good base for showing history of all devices that are located and in active use in Slovenia.

## üí°Why use RockyTracker?
The use of a simple audio detection system, a model that is trained to detect rocks of different sizes and send those events as current ongoing hazards to users online, is what we as a team were trying to achieve. An accessible platform, that can:

- Detect rockfalls using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE microphone feature

- Notify people for any upcoming device activity and show them the nearby devices from where they are viewing the website in real time using geolocation API's

- Visualize the activity live on an interactive map with the option to see threat levels

## ‚öôÔ∏èHow it works?
RockyTracker works in a simple way. Users can view the interactive map without any sign-up required, where they can:

- View all the locations of the devices that are communicating with the website using LoRaWAN gateways and TTN.

- Easily differentiate the hazard level of the location where the device is located with the use of a color coated marker legend.

- See the last documented rockfall on the selected device, when it was detected, ID of the device, size of the rocks as well as how many reports there have been on that site

- Subscribe to receive live updates for new device inputs and show devices that are within ~ 25 km while being able to unsubscribe at any time
